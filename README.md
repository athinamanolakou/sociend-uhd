## Product Pitch

Real estate analysts, developers, and policymakers in Hamilton and Toronto face a **critical challenge**: outdated data fails to represent the **misalignment** between housing demand and new developments.

Current market analysis strategies often overlook the needs of diverse populations, such as **singles, families, and the unemployed**, leading to **mismatches** in housing supply and actual community needs. This misalignment results in **missed opportunities, inefficient investments**, and slows **community growth and sustainability**. Our product is designed to **bridge this gap in the housing market**.

We focus on **highlighting**:

- The **current housing availability**.
- The **types of housing needed** by various demographic groups.

By leveraging **technological analysis tools and frameworks**, we translate **complex housing and employment datasets** into **intuitive and clear visualizations**. This will provide guidance for **investors** when deciding where and what to develop to meet the specific demographic needs of **Toronto and Hamilton**. Our goal is to **maximize profits and mitigate risks** for investors while fostering **sustainable community growth**.
