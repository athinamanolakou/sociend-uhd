                Real estate analysts and investors struggle to access comprehensive data
                into how the housing demand aligns with new developments in Hamilton and Toronto.
                Without clear visualization of trends and up to date information,
                investment decisions may be based on false or outdated information,
                leading to missed opportunities and increased risks for investments.
                Using housing data from Toronto and Hamilton, this component creates data visualization
                using only the best algorithms to find the perfect places to develop land
                alongside the right types of housing to maximize profits while minimizing risk.
                This ensures that the housing built will meet demand in good neighborhoods,
                reducing the likelihood of unfavorable investments.
